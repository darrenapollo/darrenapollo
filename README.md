### Reach me at darrenapollo@gmail.com

Welcome to my Github Readme. I am an iOS developer based in Ireland, but work remotely from anywhere. I am currently working at Sharemob, where I work on the #1 entertainment app My Talking Pet (https://apps.apple.com/app/my-talking-pet/id1427290424), among other projects. Outside of Sharemob, I am working on my own personal projects. For more information on them, see below!
