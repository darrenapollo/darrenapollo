## Sleep Soundly - White Noise
Sleep Soundly is a white noise machine, which can be customised to play specific sounds, with the ability to save custom settings for future use.

Coming soon: 
- Sound analysis using CoreML to detect when a baby is crying, and to play sleep sounds once a cry is detected to help the baby go back to sleep.
- Record your own sounds and save them to the My Recordings list to play for future use. Examples would be recording a personal lullaby or song for your baby to sleep.
